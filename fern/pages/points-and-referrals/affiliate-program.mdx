Token-Aligned Affiliate Program (TAP)

## Overview

Paradex's Token-Aligned Affiliate Program represents a fundamental shift from traditional fee-sharing models to true community alignment. Instead of earning from user fees, affiliates earn from a dedicated **1.0% token allocation (15M $DIME tokens)** that aligns their success with the long-term growth of the Paradex ecosystem.

<Warning>
This program replaces our current fee-based affiliate program and will run until the $DIME token listing.
</Warning>

## Why Token-Aligned Affiliates?

### The Problem with Fee-Share Models
Traditional affiliate programs create misaligned incentives:
- Exchanges maintain artificially high fees to fund affiliate payouts
- Affiliates encourage overtrading to maximize volume-based commissions  
- Users become the product rather than the customer

### Our Solution
**Zero conflict of interest:** Affiliate earnings come from a separate token pool, not from user fees, creating true alignment between affiliates, users, and the platform.

## How the Program Works

### Token Allocation
- **Total Pool:** 1.0% of total $DIME supply (15M tokens)
- **Distribution Period:** Throughout Season 2 remainder
- **Points Distribution:** 1M affiliate points distributed every 2 weeks

### Earning Points
You earn affiliate points from two sources:

1. **Direct Referrals:** Trading volume, deposits, open interest, and other activity from users you refer
2. **Sub-Affiliates:** Points earned by affiliates you recruit (1 level deep only)

### Lockup Tiers

Choose your commitment level and token allocation:

| Tier | Lockup Period | Token Allocation |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| **Maximalist** | 12 months from listing | Full allocation |
| **Mercenary** | 3 months from listing | 50% discount applied |

<Warning>
Your tier selection is **permanent** once chosen.
</Warning>

#### Redistribution Bonus
All discounted tokens from Mercenary affiliates are **proportionately redistributed** to Maximalist affiliates as a bonus, creating additional upside for longer-term commitment.

## Earnings Calculation

Your final token allocation is calculated as:

```
Final Tokens = (Your Points ÷ Total Points) × Pool Size × Tier Multiplier + Bonuses
```

### Example Distribution

Consider a scenario with two affiliates sharing the 15M token pool:

<Info>
**Example Scenario:** Two affiliates with equal points but different lockup commitments
</Info>

| Metric | Affiliate A (Maximalist) | Affiliate B (Mercenary) |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Points Earned** | 10,000,000 | 10,000,000 |
| **Point Share** | 50% | 50% |
| **Lockup** | 12 months | 3 months |
| **Base Allocation** | 7,500,000 tokens | 7,500,000 tokens |
| **Discount Applied** | None | -50% (3,750,000) |
| **Redistribution Bonus** | +1,875,000 tokens | None |
| **Final Allocation** | **9,375,000 tokens** | **3,750,000 tokens** |

<Note>
In this example, the Maximalist receives 75% of the total pool despite earning the same points, due to the redistribution of discounted tokens.
