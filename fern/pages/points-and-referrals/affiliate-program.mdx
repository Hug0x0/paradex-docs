## Referral Program

Earn **10% commission on XP** earned by your referred users each week.

Must refer at least $10k+ in volume to qualify. Self referrals will not be eligible for XP based commissions.


## Token-Aligned Program (TAP)

Affiliates with **$50M+ in lifetime referred volume** automatically qualify for our brand new Token-Aligned Program (TAP).

The TAP program officially starts on **Wednesday October 8, 2025** and the first TAP Points distribution will be **Wednesday October 22, 2025**.
