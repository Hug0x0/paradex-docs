Title: Referral and Affiliate Programs
---

## Overview

Paradex offers two ways to earn: our standard Referral Program for all users, and the Token-Aligned Program (TAP) for high-volume affiliates.

_The referral and affiliate sections of the Paradex App will be updated shortly to reflect the most recent program updates._

## Referral Program

Earn **10% commission on XP** earned by your referred users each week.

Must refer at least $10k+ in volume to qualify. Self referrals will not be eligible for XP based commissions.


## Token-Aligned Program (TAP)

TAP is a separate rewards program with a dedicated pool of <span style="color: #e78fff;">**1.0% of the fully diluted token supply**</span> designed for Affiliates that are uniquely positioned to help grow Paradex's user base and mindshare. This rewards pool is in addition to the standard XP program and TAP Affiliates earn from both programs simultaneously.

Potential Affiliates should apply via the [TAP Application Form](https://forms.gle/A6raA1inXn7GkqFh7) if they meet the following criteria:
* Have a large social media following or subscriber base (e.g. 5,000+ followers / subs)
* Run or are closely affiliated with one or more trading / alpha groups
* Are otherwise positioned to have an outsized impact on Paradex growth or mindshare

<small>_Note: these requirements are meant as general guidelines. Please be as descriptive as possible in your application form as to why you would make a great Paradex Affiliate_</small>

The TAP program officially starts on **Wednesday October 8, 2025** and the first TAP Points distribution will be **Wednesday October 22, 2025**. Note that this program is not linked to Paradex XP season 2.
