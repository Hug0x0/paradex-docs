## NEW: Sub-Affiliate Program

Take your earnings to the next level by referring other affiliates to Paradex:
* Earn a 10% bonus on all "Affiliate XP" earnings generated by affiliates you refer
* Earn from affiliates you directly refer (one level only)
* There is no cap on how much you can earn through the sub-affiliate program
* Sub-affiliates must meet the same eligibility criteria as regular affiliates
* You can apply to introduce an Affiliate to us via our [Affiliate application](https://forms.gle/T4UKjinSefnVgiJx8)

<Note>If you refer an affiliate who earns 10,000 Affiliate XP from their referred users, you would earn 1,000 XP (10%) as a Sub-Affiliate bonus.</Note>

## Tracking your Affiliate Status

We are making upgrades to our UI to show more detailed Affiliate stats. In the short term you can check the Affiliate Leaderboard tab of the public [Paradex Stats](https://www.paradex.trade/stats) to see how you rank and what Affiliate Tier you have earned to date.

## Sybil Detection, Self-Referral & Eligibility

* Paradex uses an innovative sybil detection system that evaluates:
    * Platform identity (Twitter, Discord, Kaito social score), and 
    * Platform activity
* Both you and your referred users must comply with our [Terms of Service](https://www.paradex.trade/terms-of-service)

<Warning>XP and referral rewards for suspected sybil accounts or self referral activity will be slashed or reduced and your Affiliate status will be revoked immediately</Warning>
