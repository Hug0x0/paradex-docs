**Season 2 is LIVE!** Earn your share of 4,000,000 XP distributed weekly every Friday.

Experience Points (XP) are Paradex's universal reward system. Every contribution to the platform earns XP, from trading to providing liquidity to community engagement.

## How to Earn XP

Meaningful user interaction with Paradex earns you XP:

- Trade and maintain open positions
- Provide tight two sided liquidy (see [Quote Quality](./quote-quality))
- Provide collateral to Paradex Vaults (protocol, vtf, community)
- Stay active through trading, referrals, research, and community engagement on X and Discord

Linking your social media accounts (e.g., X and Discord) helps us better distinguish legitimate users from Sybils.

## Season 2 Details

- **Duration:** January 3, 2025 - TBD
- **Weekly XP Pool:** 4,000,000 XP
- **Distribution:** Every Friday
- **Extension:** Up to 6 months to optimize conditions for $DIME token listing

<sub>* Affiliate bonus XP is incremental to the base weekly XP distributed to Paradex users. See the [Referrals page](./referral-program) for additional details </sub>

<sub>* Quote Quality XP is a component of the base 4M weekly XP. See the [Quote Quality page](./quote-quality) page for additional details </sub>

<Note title="S2 Extension">
The Paradex Foundation decided to extend Season 2 by up to six (6) months to ensure optimal conditions for the $DIME token listing.  The Foundation views the 6 month timeline as deliberately conservative and will accelerate listing earlier if growth and traction accelerate sooner. This extension enables the launch of spot trading, dated options, pre-markets, yield bearing synthetic dollars (XUSD).
