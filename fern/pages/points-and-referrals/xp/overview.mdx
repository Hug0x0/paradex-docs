title: Introducing XP - The New Meta for User Engagement
---

Following Pre Season, we rebuilt our entire points system from scratch. The feedback from the Paradex community was clear: Points were tough to earn and were being dominated by the big bois. We went back to the drawing board with one goal in mind – leveling the playing field and giving plebs a real shot.

Xperience Points (XP) are the new universal metric to measure and reward user engagement on Paradex. XP isn’t just a number - it’s a quantitative system for rewarding every contribution, big or small, to the Paradex ecosystem.
‍
Previously, XP allocations were transparently broken down by category with explicit weights assigned. In Season 1 and Season 2 we are adopting a more dynamic model.

This change is designed to reduce gaming of the system, minimize distribution to sybil farmers, and maximize rewards for genuine users and organic activity.
