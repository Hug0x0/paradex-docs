title: Earn XP
---

Under the new rewards system, we will provide high level guidance on activities that can earn you XP, but will no longer specify the exact formulas, weights or allocations between categories week by week.

Below are some examples of activities that can earn you XP in Season 2. Note that this list is non-exhaustive, and categories may be added or removed in the future:

* Trading and pay trading fees
* Provide liquidity (spread, depth, uptime, maker volume)
* Maintaining open trading positions
* Depositing collateral as trading margin or into Paradex Vaults
* Getting liquidated ðŸ˜³
* Trading frequently, referring friends, using new products and features, publishing community research, sharing alpha and being active in Discord

<Note title="Notes">
Linking your social media accounts (e.g., X and Discord) helps us better distinguish legitimate users from Sybils.

Users contributing to overall liquidity provision on the platform, particularly for low-volume pairs, may receive higher XP distribution.
