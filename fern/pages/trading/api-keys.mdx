subtitle: Generate credentials for programmatic access to the Paradex trading system
---

API keys allow you to interact with the Paradex trading system programmatically without using the web interface. This guide covers how to generate and manage different types of credentials for automated trading and data access.

Paradex offers three main types of API credentials:

- **Readonly Tokens**: Provide read-only access to account data and market information
- **Subkeys**: Private keys with trading permissions but restricted from withdrawals and transfers
- **Paradex Private Key**: This is your account's main private key. Users with this credential have full access to all account features.

These credentials all enable programmatic access to the Paradex API.

## Credential Comparison

| Feature | Readonly Tokens | Subkeys | Private Keys |
|---------|----------------|---------|--------------|
| **Access Level** | Read-only | Trading only | Full account access |
| **Can Place Orders** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Can Withdraw/Transfer** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Can Modify Account** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Authentication Method** | Bearer token | Private key signing | Private key signing |
| **Use Cases** | Monitoring, analytics | Automated trading | Full account management |
| **Security Risk** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Revocable** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (requires account migration) |

## Readonly Tokens

Readonly tokens provide secure, read-only access to your account data and market information. These tokens are ideal for building monitoring dashboards, creating trading analytics tools, implementing risk management systems, and developing market data applications.

  <Card title="Read-only Access" icon="fa-regular fa-eye">
    Cannot place orders or modify account settings
  </Card>
  <Card title="Revocable" icon="fa-regular fa-trash">
    Can be revoked at any time for security
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Permissions

Readonly tokens can access most GET endpoints on the API, including:

- Account balance and position information
- Order history and status
- Market data and pricing information
- Trade history and execution details

<Note>
Store tokens securely and never commit them to version control. Use environment variables or secure key management systems and regularly rotate keys for enhanced security.
</Note>

### Creating Readonly Tokens

{/* TODO: Add detailed step-by-step guide for creating readonly tokens */}

1. Navigate to account settings and locate the Key Management Section
2. While on the 'Read-only' tab, click "+ Add New Key"

3. Configure key settings (name and expiration)
4. Generate and securely store your API key. Note that this key will only be shown to you once and cannot be recovered after.
5. To revoke a Readonly token, click on the Delete button next to the token on the Read-only tab

### Using Readonly Tokens
Readonly tokens can be used just like regular auth tokens in API calls to the platform:

Use your newly generated API token in GET requests to the API
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.prod.paradex.trade/v1/balance" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <READONLY-TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Subkeys

Subkeys are keypairs for an account that do not have permissions for Withdrawal and Transfers. These keys provide a secure way to delegate trading permissions while maintaining control over account security.

  <Card title="Trading Permissions" icon="fa-regular fa-chart-line">
    Can place and manage orders
  </Card>
  <Card title="Restricted Transfers" icon="fa-regular fa-ban">
    Cannot withdraw funds or transfer to other accounts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Account Isolation" icon="fa-regular fa-shield">
    Operate within specific account parameters
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enhanced Security" icon="fa-regular fa-lock">
    Separate from main account private key
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Permissions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Subkeys Can">
    - Place buy and sell orders
    - Cancel existing orders
    - Modify order parameters
    - Access account balance and positions
    - View order history and trade data
    - Access market data and pricing
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Subkeys Cannot">
    - Withdraw funds from the account
    - Transfer funds to other accounts
    - Modify account settings
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Use Cases

- **Automated trading bots**: Deploy trading strategies without full account access
- **Third-party integrations**: Allow trusted applications to trade on your behalf
- **Team trading**: Enable multiple team members to trade with controlled permissions

### Creating Subkeys

1. Navigate to account security settings and locate Key Management
2. Click on the 'Subkeys' toggle, then click on '+ Add New Key'
<img src="../../assets/add-subkey.png" alt="Create New Subkey"/>
3. Give your subkey a name
4. Generate and securely store your subkey private key. The private key is not stored on the server and will only be shown once.
5. The public key component can be copied on the Subkeys tab. This public key can also be derived from the private key.
5. To revoke a Subkey, click on the Delete button next to the token on the Subkeys tab

### Using Subkeys
Subkeys behave like regular private keys. They are used for
- Getting JWT Tokens from the `/auth/:public_key` [endpoint](api/general-information/authentication)
- Signing requests to [create/modify orders](/api/prod/orders/new)

Please refer to the SDK documentation on how to use your Private key to interact with on Paradex via API.
- [paradex-py](https://github.com/tradeparadex/paradex-py)
- [paradex-js](https://github.com/tradeparadex/paradex.js)

#### Generating Auth Tokens
While using a subkey:
- The auth endpoint should be `/auth/{public_key}`
- The header `PARADEX-STARKNET-ACCOUNT' header to the request should be the address of the main account
- The `PARADEX-STARKNET-SIGNATURE` must be generated by signing using the subkey private key.
