subtitle: We believe that financial privacy is a fundamental right.

<Note>
  Account Privacy is currently in Alpha. During this time, existing RPC nodes without privacy protection will remain publicly accessible.
</Note>

Our off-chain orderbook hides order data from the public.
However, since account data are stored on-chain, additional methods are needed to provide privacy to users.

We are taking a phased approach to Account Privacy, rolling out stronger privacy with each phase.

1. Full Position Privacy through RPC Masking âœ…
2. Permanent Privacy through Encrypted DA
3. Privacy secured at the Smart Contract level

## How Privacy Works Today

  <Card title="Masked by Default" icon="fa-regular fa-mask">
    Account data is hidden from others

  <Card title="Authentication Reveals your Data" icon="fa-regular fa-key-skeleton">
    You can access your own data when authenticated with your private key

<Tip>
Privacy protection lasts ~6 hours until data is submitted to L1. Future phases will provide permanent privacy.
