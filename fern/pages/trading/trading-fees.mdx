## Fee Calculation

Fees are calculated based on the **notional value** of your trade, not the margin you put up.

<Tip title="Fee Example">
  If you open a $25,000 ETH perpetual position with $2,500 in margin (10x
  leverage), fees are charged on the full $25,000 notional value, not your
  $2,500 margin.
