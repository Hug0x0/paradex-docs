## Fee Structure

### Perpetual Futures (FREE for Retail Traders!)

#### Trading via Application / GUI
| Order Type | Maker Fee | Taker Fee |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| All Orders | **Free** (0%) | **Free** (0%) |

All trading through the Paradex application and web interface is **completely free**. This includes both maker and taker orders for all perpetual futures contracts. There are no minimum volume requirements or conditions at this time.

#### Trading via API
| Order Type | Maker Fee | Taker Fee | Comments |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | -------- |
| Standard API Orders | **Free** (0%) | 2.0 bp (0.02%) | NA |
| RPI Orders | 0.5 bp (0.005%) | N/A | Special order type that can only be matched with GUI orders |

API trading follows a maker-taker fee model. **Maker orders** (orders that add liquidity to the order book) are free, while **taker orders** (orders that remove liquidity) incur fees of 2.0 bp.

**RPI (Retail Price Improvement) orders** are a special maker order type designed to provide liquidity specifically to GUI users. These orders can only be matched against GUI taker orders and makers pay a small 0.5 bp fee for these special lane orders.

### Perpetual Options
| Order Type | Taker Fee | Maker Fee | Cap / Floor |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| All Orders | 0.03%     | -0.01%    | 25% / -8%   |

## Settlement Fee Structure
| Instrument        | Fee    | Cap |
| ----------------- | ------ | --- |
| Perpetual Futures | 0.015% | N/A |
| Perpetual Options | 0.01%  | 25% |

### Fee Calculation
Fees are calculated based on the **notional value** of your trade, not the margin you put up.
The notional value represents the total dollar amount of the underlying assets being traded.

<Tip title="Fee Example">
  If you open a \$25,000 ETH perpetual position with \$2,500 in margin (10x
  leverage), fees are charged on the full \$25,000 notional value, not your
  \$2,500 margin.
