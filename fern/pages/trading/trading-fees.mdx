## Fee Structure

| Instrument        | Taker Fee | Maker Fee | Cap |
| ----------------- | --------- | --------- | ----|
| Perpetual Futures | 0.03%     | -0.005%   | N/A |
| Perpetual Options | 0.03%     | 0.03%     | 50% |


### Fee Calculation

Fees are calculated based on the **notional value** of your trade, not the margin you put up.
The notional value represents the total dollar amount of the underlying assets being traded.

<Tip title="Fee Example">
If you open a \$25,000 ETH perpetual position with \$2,500 in margin (10x leverage), fees are charged on the full \$25,000 notional value, not your \$2,500 margin.
