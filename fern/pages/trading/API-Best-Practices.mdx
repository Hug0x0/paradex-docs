## Batch Order Operations

**Efficiency Multiplier:** Single batch request = 1 rate limit unit (regardless of 1-50 orders). Use `POST /orders/batch` and `DELETE /orders/batch` for 50x efficiency improvement vs individual operations.

**Implementation:** Batch operations support partial failures - individual order rejections won't block others. Process response arrays to handle mixed success/failure scenarios. All orders validated by risk engine independently.

## Real-Time BBO Feeds

**WebSocket Channel:** `bbo.{market_symbol}` provides immediate best bid/offer updates with no artificial throttling. Event-driven updates only when price/size changes - use sequence numbers for message ordering.

**Feed Selection:** BBO is optimal for price-only strategies and useful when subscribing to snapshot books. For fastest BBO price changes, use BBO feed directly. For fastest full orderbook depth, subscribe to deltas websocket feed instead.

**Multi-Market Strategy:** Subscribe to BBO feeds for all trading markets simultaneously. Each subscription costs minimal resources and provides real-time pricing for optimal execution decisions.

## Rate Optimization

**Order Management:** `POST /orders` and `DELETE /orders` share 800 req/s limit pool. Batch operations consume 1 unit regardless of order count (1-50), providing significant efficiency gains for market makers.

**Client ID Optimization:** Avoid using client IDs on orders when possible to reduce processing overhead. Only include client IDs when order tracking is essential for your strategy.

**Signing Optimization:** Order signing is computationally expensive. Pre-sign static order components and only process variable parts (price, size, timestamp) for each new order to reduce latency in high-frequency scenarios.

## WebSocket Rate Management

**Connection Limits:** 20 connections/second, 600 connections/minute per IP. Maintain persistent connections rather than frequent reconnects for optimal performance.

**Channel Strategy:** Subscribe to essential channels only: `bbo.{market}`, `fills.{market}`, `positions`, `order`. Avoid unnecessary subscriptions that consume bandwidth.

**Message Processing:** Drain WebSocket messages quickly to prevent disconnection. Exchange will disconnect if 2000+ messages accumulate unprocessed. Implement fast message handling and avoid blocking operations in message callbacks.

**Reconnection Logic:** Implement robust reconnection with backoff that respects rate limits (20 connections/second, 600/minute). Queue critical operations during reconnection to avoid data loss.

## Latency Monitoring

**Timestamp Analysis:** Use order response timestamps to monitor network latency for both REST and WebSocket. Track `published_at`, `received_at`, `created_at`, `last_updated_at` fields to identify bottlenecks in your trading pipeline.

## System State Monitoring

**Operational Status:** Poll `GET /v1/system/state` to monitor exchange operational state. Handle three status values: `ok` (fully operational), `maintenance` (trading unavailable), `cancel_only` (only cancellations allowed).

**Implementation Strategy:** Check system state before trading operations and adapt behavior accordingly. During `cancel_only` periods, halt new order submissions but continue order cancellations to manage risk.
