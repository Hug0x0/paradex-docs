## Margin Modes

Paradex offers two distinct margin modes to accommodate different trading strategies:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Cross Margin" icon="c" href="/risk/cross-margin-requirement">
    Margin shared across all positions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Isolated Margin" icon="i">
    Margin based on individual positions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Instrument Types

All instruments are quoted and valued in USD.

Paradex currently supports only USDC as a collateral asset. You have to deposit USDC on your wallet to trade and all PnL accrued or charged to your wallet will be in USDC.

## Margin Checks

Paradex performs two critical margin checks to ensure platform stability and protect against market manipulation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Margin Check">
    Validates that an account can take additional risk. Examples of when this check is performed:
    - Submitting new orders
    - Requesting withdrawals that would increase account leverage
  </Step>
  <Step title="Maintenance Margin Check">
    Determines if an account is approaching bankruptcy. 
    
    <Error title="If an account fails this check">
      Account positions and balances will be liquidated
    </Error>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### How Margin Checks Work

All margin checks follow a simple comparison formula:

```
Account Value ≥ Margin Requirement
```

| Component | Cross Margin | Isolated Margin |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Account Value** | Sum of<br/>• USD Collateral (USDC balance)<br/>• Unrealized PnL from all positions<br/>• Benefits from PnL offsetting across positions | Position Value only |
| **Margin Requirement** | Based on<br/>• All open positions<br/>• Exchange-level parameters<br/>• [Cross Margin Requirement](cross-margin-requirement) methodology | Based on<br/>• Individual position only<br/>• Exchange-level parameters |

For detailed calculations of Account Value and related risk metrics, see the [Margin Term Reference](margin-term-reference).
