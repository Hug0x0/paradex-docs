## Public Endpoints

The rate limit for all of our public API endpoints is set to a maximum _<span style={{color: '#C760ED'}}>1500 requests per minute</span>_ per IP address.

Exceptions:

* `POST /onboarding` & `POST /auth`: These endpoints have a shared rate limit of _<span style={{color: '#C760ED'}}>600 requests per minute</span>_ per IP address.

## Private Endpoints (Per-account limits)

For our private API endpoints, the rate limit varies according to the specific endpoint:

* `POST /orders` & `DELETE /orders` & `PUT /orders`: These endpoints have a shared rate limit of _<span style={{color: '#C760ED'}}>800 requests per second or 17250 requests per minute</span>_ per account.
* `GET /*`: All GET endpoints have a shared rate limit of _<span style={{color: '#C760ED'}}>120 requests per second or 600 requests per minute</span>_ per account.

For private endpoints the rate limits are per account and not per IP, but a general limit of _<span style={{color: '#C760ED'}}>1500 requests per minute</span>_ per IP address is still applied (except for `/orders` endpoints)
