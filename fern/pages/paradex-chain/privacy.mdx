# üîê Privacy on Paradex

Privacy is a fundamental pillar of Paradex's architecture and philosophy. We believe that financial privacy is not just a luxury, but a necessity for institutional adoption, regulatory compliance, and user protection in decentralized finance.

## Why Privacy Matters

### **Institutional Adoption**
Large institutional traders require privacy to prevent front-running, market manipulation, and strategic disadvantages. When trading positions and strategies are visible on-chain, it creates asymmetric information that can be exploited by other market participants.

### **Regulatory Compliance**
Financial institutions must navigate complex regulatory requirements including data protection (GDPR for personal data), market transparency obligations (MiFID II), and customer confidentiality duties. Privacy-preserving solutions help institutions balance these requirements while protecting legitimate business interests and client confidentiality.

### **Market Efficiency**
Public visibility of all trading activity can lead to:
- **Front-running**: Bad actors executing trades ahead of known large orders
- **Sandwich attacks**: Manipulating prices around known transactions
- **Liquidation hunting**: Manipulating prices to force liquidation of positions
- **MEV extraction**: Extracting value from predictable trading patterns
- **Reduced liquidity**: Traders avoiding the platform due to lack of privacy

### **User Protection**
Privacy protects users from:
- Targeted attacks based on known wallet balances
- Social engineering based on trading patterns
- Competitive disadvantage in trading strategies
- Unwanted attention from holding large positions

## Our Current Solution: Privacy-Preserving RPC Proxy

Today, Paradex implements privacy through our **authenticated RPC node proxy system**:

### **How It Works**
1. **Account-Based Authentication**: Users authenticate with their account's private key
2. **Selective Data Access**: Authenticated users can only access their own account data
3. **Data Masking**: All other users' data is masked and filtered from responses
4. **Public Data Accessibility**: General blockchain data remains accessible to everyone

### **Benefits**
- **Immediate Privacy**: Works with current StarkNet infrastructure
- **Zero Trust**: No need to trust Paradex with sensitive data
- **Selective Access**: Users control what data they can access
- **Regulatory Friendly**: Complies with financial privacy requirements

### **Limitations**
- **Infrastructure Dependency**: Requires centralized proxy infrastructure
- **Performance Overhead**: Additional authentication and filtering required

## The Future: Smart Contract-Level Privacy

The ultimate privacy solution for Paradex will implement **privacy directly at the smart contract level using zk-STARKs**, providing cryptographic guarantees rather than relying on access control mechanisms.

All sensitive trading data will be stored as encrypted blobs on-chain:
- **Positions**: Encrypted position sizes, leverage, and liquidation points
- **Balances**: Account balances hidden from public view
- **Trade History**: Transaction patterns and trading strategies protected
- **Order Books**: Pending orders remain confidential until execution

### **Smart Contract Verification**
On-chain verification occurs without exposing underlying transaction details:
- **Proof Validation**: Smart contracts verify zk-STARK proofs cryptographically
- **State Updates**: Valid transactions update encrypted state
- **Public Verifiability**: Anyone can verify proof validity without accessing private data
- **Consensus Integration**: Proofs integrate seamlessly with StarkNet consensus

### **Benefits**

This smart contract-level privacy approach delivers comprehensive advantages across multiple dimensions:

- **Cryptographic Privacy Guarantees**: zk-STARKs provide mathematical certainty of privacy, not just access control
- **No Trusted Intermediaries**: Privacy enforcement happens cryptographically, eliminating reliance on third parties
- **User-Controlled Data Access**: Users maintain complete control over their data encryption keys and disclosure permissions
