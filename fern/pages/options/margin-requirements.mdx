Paradex currently supports Cross Margin for Perpetual Options, allowing traders to benefit from PnL offsetting across futures and options markets.

Shortly, Paradex will also offer **Portfolio Margin** which will significantly improve margin requirements for hedged portfolios, particularly for users that are short Perpetual Options.

<Tip title="Core Idea" icon="leaf">
Cross Margin Requirements for Perpetual Options depend on their type (call/put), moneyness (out-of-money vs in-the money) and the mark price of the Option.

# Margin Calculation

**For Buying Options:**  
min(Premium Multiplier × Option Mark Price, long_itm × Spot Price)

**For Selling Options:**  
max(short_itm × Spot Price - OTM Amount, short_otm × Spot Price)

where OTM Amount is:
- For calls: max(0, Strike Price - Spot Price)
- For puts: max(0, Spot Price - Strike Price)

Margin requirements for short put options are capped at short_put_cap × Strike Price to prevent excessively high requirements.

The margin plots below show the margin requirements for both call and put options across various strikes ranging from deep out the money (OTM) to in the money (ITM).
