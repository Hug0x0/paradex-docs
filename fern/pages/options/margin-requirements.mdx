title: Margin Requirements for Options
---
Paradex currently supports Cross Margin for Perpetual Options. This means that users can trade options together with Perpetual Futures and benefit from PnL offsetting across all futures and options markets.

Cross Margin Requirements for options depends on their type (call/put), moneyness (out-of-money vs in-the money) and the mark price.

Paradex will soon enable Portfolio Margin (coming Jan 2025) which will unlock much higher capital efficiency for hedged accounts. Portfolios with low risk will benefit from much lower margin requirements under Portfolio Margin Mode
