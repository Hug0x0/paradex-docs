# Funding Mechanism

The funding mechanism is how Perpetual Options maintain their perpetual nature. Long positions continuously pay short positions a funding rate based on the option's time value.

- **Funding Period:** 24 hours (funding is paid continuously)
- **Funding Premium:** The total amount of funding paid over the funding period, equal to the time value of the option:
  
  Funding Premium = Time Value = Mark Price - Intrinsic Value

<Tip title="Core Idea" icon="leaf">
The Funding Period is a critical concept to understand. It represents the expected period of time over which a user will pay the time value of the option via Funding. This is a parameter chosen by Paradex and is what makes the current Perpetual Option similar (but not equal to) a 24 hour dated option.

## Example

For a BTC-USD-101000-C with:
- Spot Price: $100,000
- Mark Price: $500
- Intrinsic Value: $0 (out-of-the-money)
- Time Value: $500

If Dave buys 5 contracts and holds for 1 hour with unchanged prices:
- Funding PnL = -5 × ($500 × 1/24) = -$104.17

Funding accrues continuously as unrealized PnL and is realized whenever the position is updated.

# Mark Price Calculation

The price of a Perpetual Option depends on:
- Option type (call/put)
- Spot Oracle Price of the underlying asset
- Strike Price
- Mark Implied Volatility (Mark IV)
- Interest Rate (derived from Paradex Futures Funding Rate)
- Funding period (24 hours)

Paradex calculates prices using the Black-Scholes formula adapted for perpetual options with continuous funding.

**Mark IV:** Paradex maintains a Mark Implied Volatility that reflects a fair estimate of market IV even when the option is illiquid. This is derived from:
- Best bid/ask prices
- Last trade price
- Mid price
- External IV calibrated from Deribit dated options
