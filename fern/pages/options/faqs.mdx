<Accordion title="How to read a Perpetual Option Symbol">
Paradex Perpetual Options are defined by :

- **Underlying Asset :** For example BTC
- **Quote Asset :** All Paradex instruments are quoted in USD
- **Strike Price**
- **Option Type**
    - C → Call Option
    - P → Put Option

Example : BTC-USD-101000-C represents a Perpetual BTC Call Option with a 101,000 Strike Price

<Accordion title="What is a Perpetual Option">
Paradex Perpetual Options are perpetual instruments where the long positions continuously pay the short positions funding that depends on the time value of the option, where the time value is the difference between the mark price of the option and the intrinsic value of the option ( *= Mark Price - Intrinsic Value*)

The Intrinsic Value corresponds to the payoff of a European Option

- It is equal to :
    
    $\max(\text{Spot Price}-\text{Strike Price},~0)$ for ***Call Options***
    
    $\max(\text{Strike Price}-\text{Spot Price},~0)$ for ***Put Options***
    

Example :

Spot Price = $100,000

- BTC-USD-101000-C has an Intrinsic Value equal to zero since Spot Price < Strike Price
    
    Assuming the Mark Price of BTC-USD-101000-C is \$500, the Time Value is also **\$500**
    
- BTC-USD-101000-P has an Intrinsic Value equal to Strike Price - Spot Price = \$1,000
    
    Assuming the Mark Price of BTC-USD-101000-P is \$1,490, the Time Value is also **\$490**

<Accordion title="How to interpret Options Funding">
Unlike futures, where the funding rate reflects only the cost of leverage, the funding rate for perpetual options reflects both the cost of leverage (adjusted for delta) plus the cost of convexity. 

This a simple framework for perpetual traders because the funding rate is well understood for options. So this product is well suited for the universe of perpetual futures traders that want leverage but don’t want to deal with downside, and are willing to pay a little extra in funding for this insurance.

<Accordion title="What is the Funding Period">
The **Funding Period** is the period over which the Funding Premium is paid, where the Funding Premium is the USDC equivalent of the option price for out-of-money options (and more generally Time Value = Mark Price - Intrinsic Value). The Funding Premium refers to an amount that is continuously paid over 8 hours (assuming no price changes)

Example :

Spot Price = \$100,000

1 USDC = 1 USD

Funding Period = 8 hours

BTC-USD-99000-C has a price of \$500. Since the option is out-of-money (i.e. zero intrinsic value), the time value is also \$500. This corresponds to a **Funding Premium** of 500 USDC.

If Alice buys 5 BTC-USD-99000-C. ***After 1 hour*** and if market prices are unchanged, Alice will have a Funding PnL of -5 * (500 * 1 / 8) = \$312.5
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When is Funding Realized">
Similar to Paradex Perpetual Futures, funding is continuously accrued as unrealized PnL and is realized whenever the position is updated.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is Mark Price calculated">
The price of a Perpetual Option depends on :

- Type of the option (call/put)
- Spot Oracle Price of the underlying asset
- Strike Price of the option
- The Implied Volatility of the underlying asset (Mark IV)
- Interest Rate : This is derived from Paradex Futures Funding Rate
- The funding period of the option (8 hours)

The price is calculated using the Black Scholes formula for perpetual options with continuous funding
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is Mark IV calculated">
Paradex keeps track of a Mark IV (IV refers to Implied Volatility). Mark IV is a smooth function of best bid/ask, last trade, mid price as well as an external IV calibrated from Deribit dated options. The Mark IV is designed to reflect a fair estimate of implied volatility even when the option is illiquid.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are key differences between Perpetual and Dated Options">
A Perpetual Option inherits many of the traditional Dated Option properties but fits it into the simpler and more flexible perpetual framework.

As a rough comparison, Perpetual Option can be thought of as Dated Option with a time to expiry equal to its funding period. This means that Paradex perpetual options prices are roughly close to prices of Dated Options expiring in 8 hours. Given the timing flexibility, the prices are not exactly equal (perpetual options have a different pricing formula).

The main difference is that Perpetual Options do not have a Time Decay. Unlike Dated Options which price is negatively impacted by the passage of time (option becomes cheaper as it gets close to expiry, if spot price and IV are not changing), perpetual options do not have an expiry and therefore their price is not affected by time.

Instead, the holder of a Perpetual Option pays for this perpetual exposure through funding. Funding replaces time decay in the perpetual framework.

A key difference here is that in a dated option, you pay the time premium upfront vs in a perpetual option you pay it over the funding period (in Paradex’s case it’s paid continuously)

The Perpetual Option can be effectively as an intraday dated option with automatic adjustment/rolling to maintain a constant time-to-expiry.

<Accordion title="What are Margin Requirements for Options">
Paradex currently supports Cross Margin for Perpetual Options. This means that users can trade options together with Perpetual Futures and benefit from PnL offsetting across all futures and options markets.

Cross Margin Requirements for options depends on their type (call/put), moneyness (out-of-money vs in-the money) and the mark price.

Paradex will soon enable Portfolio Margin (coming Jan 2025) which will unlock much higher capital efficiency for hedged accounts. Portfolios with low risk will benefit from much lower margin requirements under Portfolio Margin Mode
