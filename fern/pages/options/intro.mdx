# What are Perpetual Options?

Perpetual Options are a novel new crypto derivative instrument that combines the risk-reward profile of options (protected downside with unlimited upside) with the simplicity of perpetual futures.

<Tip title="Core Idea" icon="leaf">
Perpetual Options fit naturally within the derivative framework crypto traders know and love (perpetuals) while offering a new way to access leverage without taking price-based liquidation risk.
</Tip>

Perpetual options are:

1. Options that never expire - Unlike traditional options that have a fixed expiration date, Perpetual Options can be held indefinitely, reducing expiry timing risk

2. Continuously funded instruments - Instead of paying a large premium upfront, traders pay (or receive) a continuous funding rate based on market conditions to hold a position

3. Simplified derivatives - They follow the same straightforward PnL structure as perpetual futures (entry price, exit price, funding)

# Why Trade Perpetual Options?

Perpetual options blend the upside of leverage with built‑in downside protection—so you can stay in a trade, without the constant threat of getting liquidated (by price).

<Tip title="Core Idea" icon="leaf">
*Perp Options Funding = Cost of Leverage + Built‑in Insurance*

In perp options, the extra funding also covers downside protection, so price swings are less deadly.

*Perp Futures Funding = Cost of Leverage*

In perp futures, funding just pays for leverage.

# Comparing to Dated Options

| **Feature**         | **Perpetual Options**           | **Dated Options**                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Expiration          | Never expire                    | Expire at a specific date and time      |
| Time Decay          | No time decay (theta)           | Value decreases as expiration approaches |
| Premium Payment     | Paid continuously through funding | Paid upfront as a lump sum            |
| Liquidity           | Concentrated in fewer instruments | Fragmented across strikes and expiries |
| Behavior            | Like a rolling 24-hour option   | Fixed time horizon                      |
| Risk Management     | No expiry mismatch with perps   | Require active management of expiry     |

<Tip title="Core Idea" icon="leaf">
Perpetual Options can be thought of as dated options with a time to expiry equal to their funding period (roughly 24 hours). However, instead of continuously buying new dated options as they expire, the funding mechanism automatically "rolls" your position forward.

# Comparing to Perpetual Futures Options

| **Feature**          | **Perpetual Options**                 | **Perpetual Futures**                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Payoff Structure     | Non Linear and Asymmetric<br>*(Accelerated Upside + Limited Downside)* | Linear and Symmetric<br>*(unlimited upside and downside)* |
| Leverage             | Variable leverage based on option delta | Fixed leverage based on margin          |
| Funding              | Includes cost of leverage plus convexity | Only reflects cost of leverage         |
| Liquidation Risk     | Lower liquidation risk (for buyers)   | Higher liquidation risk                   |
| Capital Efficiency   | May require less capital for similar exposure | Requires more capital to avoid liquidation |

<Tip title="Core Idea" icon="leaf">
In simple terms, Perpetual Options can be thought of as "insurance-enhanced" perpetual futures, where you pay a higher funding rate in exchange for protection against adverse price movements.
</Tip>

# Margin and Risk Comparison

A key advantage of Perpetual Options is their unique margin structure compared to perpetual futures:
* **High leverage without liquidation risk from price movements** - Unlike futures, option buyers cannot be liquidated due to adverse price movements
* **High effective leverage** - Especially with out-of-the-money options, achieve effective leverage >50x
* **Known maximum loss** - Your maximum risk is limited to the funding you pay while holding the position
This margin structure makes Perpetual Options a powerful alternative to futures for leveraged trading, offering an asymmetric return profile with liquidation risk where liquidation risk is transformed into a manageable, transparent funding rate.
