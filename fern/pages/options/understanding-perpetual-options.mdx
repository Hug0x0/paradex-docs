# Perpetual Options Explained

Perpetual Options combine features of traditional options with a funding mechanism that allows them to exist without expiration dates.

## Core Concepts

### Mark Price Calculation

The price of a Perpetual Option depends on:

  <Card title="Option Type" icon="toggle-left">
    Call or Put option
  </Card>
  <Card title="Spot Oracle Price" icon="activity">
    Current price of the underlying asset
  </Card>
  <Card title="Strike Price" icon="target">
    Predetermined price at which the option can be exercised
  </Card>
  <Card title="Mark Implied Volatility (Mark IV)" icon="bar-chart-2">
    Estimated volatility used in price calculations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Interest Rate" icon="percent">
    Derived from Paradex Futures Funding Rate
  </Card>
  <Card title="Funding Period" icon="clock">
    Set at 24 hours for continuous funding
  </Card>
</Cards>

Paradex calculates prices using the Black-Scholes formula adapted for perpetual options with continuous funding.

**Mark IV:** Paradex maintains a Mark Implied Volatility that reflects a fair estimate of market IV even when the option is illiquid. This is derived from:
- Best bid/ask prices
- Last trade price
- Mid price
- External IV calibrated from Deribit dated options

### Time Value

In Perpetual Options, Time Value is the difference between the mark price of the option and its intrinsic value:

$$\text{Time Value} = \text{Mark Price} - \text{Intrinsic Value}$$

This Time Value represents the premium traders are willing to pay for the option's potential future value.

### Funding Mechanism

The funding mechanism is how Perpetual Options maintain their perpetual nature. Long positions continuously pay short positions a funding rate based on the option's time value.

- **Funding Period:** 24 hours (funding is paid continuously)
- **Funding Premium:** The total amount of funding paid over the funding period, equal to the time value of the option:
  
  Funding Premium = Time Value = Mark Price - Intrinsic Value

<Tip title="Core Idea" icon="leaf">
The Funding Period is a critical concept to understand. It represents the expected period of time over which a user will pay the time value of the option via Funding. This is a parameter chosen by Paradex and is what makes the current Perpetual Option similar (but not equal to) a 24 hour dated option.

#### Example

For a BTC-USD-101000-C with:
- Spot Price: $100,000
- Mark Price: $500
- Intrinsic Value: $0 (out-of-the-money)
- Time Value: $500

If Dave buys 5 contracts and holds for 1 hour with unchanged prices:
- Funding PnL = -5 × ($500 × 1/24) = -$104.17

Funding accrues continuously as unrealized PnL and is realized whenever the position is updated.

## Perpetual Option Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Perpetual Call Options">
    Similar to a traditional dated call option, a Perpetual Call Option gives the holder the right to benefit from price increases above the strike price. The intrinsic value of a Call option is:
    
    $\text{max}(\text{Spot Price} - \text{Strike Price}, 0)$
    
    - When Spot Price > Strike Price: The option is "in-the-money" (ITM)
    - When Spot Price < Strike Price: The option is "out-of-the-money" (OTM)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Perpetual Put Options">
    Similar to a traditional dated put option, a Perpetual Put Option gives the holder the right to benefit from price decreases below the strike price. The intrinsic value of a Put option is:
    
    $\text{max}(\text{Strike Price} - \text{Spot Price}, 0)$
    
    - When Spot Price < Strike Price: The option is "in-the-money" (ITM)
    - When Spot Price > Strike Price: The option is "out-of-the-money" (OTM)
  </Tab>
