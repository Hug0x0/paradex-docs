## Aggregate multiple fills on trade history

![Screenshot](../../assets/changelog/07-04-25/aggregate-fills.gif)

Track your trades more easily with our new fill aggregation feature.
When a single order results in multiple partial fills, you can now view them as one consolidated entry instead of cluttered individual fills.

Toggle between detailed and consolidated views using the "Aggregate" option in your Trade History tab and TradingView chart.
